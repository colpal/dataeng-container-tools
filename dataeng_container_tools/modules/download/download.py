        This is the primary user-facing download function. It offers multiple modes of
        operation via the `output` parameter, allowing users to:
        - Wait for all downloads to complete (`output="complete"`).
        - Receive a generator yielding (URL, Path) tuples as files are downloaded (`output="generator"`).
        - Receive a context manager containing Future objects for each download task (`output="futures"`).

        Args:
            urls_to_files: A mapping where keys are URLs (str)
                and values are local file paths (str or Path) where the content will be saved.
            **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments that are passed to `download_to_file`.
                See `download_to_file` for more details on available options such as:
                - `headers`: HTTP headers.
                - `max_workers`: Maximum number of workers.
                - `chunk_size`: Chunk size for streaming.
                - `timeout`: Request timeout.
                - `decode_content`: Whether to decode content.
                - mode: Specifies the type of executor to use.
                    "thread" for `ThreadPoolExecutor`, "process" for `ProcessPoolExecutor`.
                    Defaults to "thread".
                - output: Determines the return behavior. Defaults to "complete".
                    "complete": Waits for all downloads to finish and returns None.
                    "generator": Returns a generator that yields `(url, Path)` tuples
                    as each download completes.
                    "futures": Returns a context manager that yields a set of `Future` objects
                    for each submitted download task and automatically handles executor cleanup.

        Returns:
            The return type depends on the `output` keyword argument:
                - `None`: If `output` is "complete" (default).
                - `Generator[tuple[str, Path]]`: If `output` is "generator".
                - `_ExecutorContext`: If `output` is "futures". A context manager that yields
                  a set of Future objects when entered.

            NotImplementedError: If an invalid `output` mode is specified.
            Exceptions from `requests` (e.g., `requests.exceptions.HTTPError`) can be
            raised during the download process, especially when `output="futures"`
            and `future.result()` is called. For "complete" and "generator" modes,
            exceptions are caught and logged.

        Examples:
            Download a single file and wait for completion:
                >>> urls = {"http://example.com/file1.txt": "local_file1.txt"}
                >>> Download.download(urls) # Default output="complete"

                ...     "http://example.com/image.jpg": "image.jpg",
                ...     "http://example.com/data.csv": "data/data.csv"

                ...     print(f"Downloaded {url} to {path}")
